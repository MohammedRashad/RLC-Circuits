# RLC-Circuits
Modeling RLC circuits response by MATLAB &amp; Simulink

This project models an equivalent/simple RLC circuits (Parallel) and calculates the step response and natural response voltages/currents then plots them in MATLAB and Simulink.

- In MATLAB, solving the circuits using general solution method.
- In Simulink, the circuits are solved using integrators. 

# Natural Response

#### What's this ?

The response of a circuit to the sudden disconnection of a DC voltage or current source.
<br/><br/>
In electrical engineering and mechanical engineering, a transient response or natural response is the response of a system to a change from an equilibrium or a steady state. The transient response is not necessarily tied to "on/off" events but to any event that affects the equilibrium of the system.

# Step Response

#### What's this ? 

The response of a circuit to the sudden application of a DC voltage or current source.
<br/><br/>
The step response of a system in a given initial state consists of the time evolution of its outputs when its control inputs are Heaviside step functions. In electronic engineering and control theory, step response is the time behaviour of the outputs of a general system when its inputs change from zero to one in a very short time.
